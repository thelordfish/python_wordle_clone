# Wordle Backend (Coursework)

Backend for a Wordle game written in Python for a programming assignment during my MSc, achieving 85%.

The file `wordle_backend.py` handles:

- loading dictionaries  
- checking inputs and guesses  
- updating game state  
- saving/loading state using pickle to create save files
- generating clue colours  
- basic history tracking  
- optional hint generation  

It was designed to be used by a separate frontend provided for the assignment.
